            I will not repeat the mistakes I have made. <br/>

            I will not let myself Cause my heart so much misery. <br/>

            I ve learned the hard way. <br/>

            so never let it get that far. <br/>

            Because of you. <br/>

            I will not make the same mistakes that you did. <br/>

            I will not make the same mistakes that you did. <br/>

            I never stray too far from the sidewalk. <br/>

            Because of you. <br/>

            I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me. <br/>

            Because of you. <br/>

            I am afraid. <br/>

            I lose my way ï¼ŒAnd it s not too long before you point it out.<br/>

            I cannot cry.<br/>

            Because I know that's weakness in your eyes. <br/>

            I m forced to fake a smile, a laugh everyday of my life. <br/>

            My heart can't possibly break. <br/>

            When it wasn't even whole to start with. <br/>

            Because of you. <br/>
